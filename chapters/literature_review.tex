\chapter{Literature Review}
Automatic Number Plate Recognition system is in state of research and development but in context of Nepal due to lack of proper dataset only small number of researches have been made. Recently Automatic Number Plate Recognition(ANPR) systems have been developed using deep learning techniques like Support Vector Machine(SVM), Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), Deep Neural Network(DNN) e.t.c along with good image processing algorithms for number plate localization and character segmentation.\\\\
The paper "Automatic Nepali Number Plate recognition with Support Vector Machines" by Pant et al. \cite{pant2015automatic} used support vector machines for character recognition and achieved overall accuracy of 75\%. However due to use of incomplete dataset this system may fail to recognize number plates of all the zones.
